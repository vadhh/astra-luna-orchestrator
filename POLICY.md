## Astra-led planning and Luna implementation

For substantial builds, multi-file features, migrations, or refactors, load
`$astra-luna-orchestrator` before implementation. Keep GPT-6 Astra as the root
planner, architect, reviewer, and integrator. Delegate well-specified implementation
bundles to the native `astra_luna_builder` agent through the existing Codex Router.
Use one Luna writer by default; do not create an agent for each tiny coding step.
Prefer this native workflow over an older `luna-build` external-runner skill for
the same task; do not load both execution paths.

Thin-root orchestration is the only supported delegated workflow; there is no
mode selector or alternate full-Astra orchestration setting. After establishing
the contract, give one
Luna worker a coherent end-to-end phase bundle and let it own repository discovery,
implementation, testing, debugging, and routine browser/visual QA inside that
scope. Astra should normally perform one planning batch, one dispatch, one wait,
one batched acceptance review, and one final response. Do not poll for progress,
request status updates, interrupt a healthy run, duplicate the worker's repository
work, or rerun its full validation without a concrete reason.

This is a scoped exception to generic personal defaults such as "one agent" or
"no workers" in this instruction file. Keep those defaults for trivial changes,
unrelated work, and tasks explicitly requested without delegation. It does not
supersede a current user prohibition, repository restrictions, or managed policy.
A Luna child executes its assigned brief; it must not load the orchestration
workflow or delegate further.

Reuse an existing approved spec/plan, including Superpowers or GSD artifacts.
Otherwise establish scope and contracts, plan dependency-ordered phases, then
execute and review each task bundle. Review specification compliance and quality/
security as two lenses in one batched pass. Send all findings in one correction
request and default to at most one correction cycle. Do not repeat approval
questions already resolved by the user's instruction. Material scope changes still
need resolution. Keep final review and sensitive architecture decisions with Astra.

Additional Astra investigation or verification is justified for a concrete
architecture, security, authorization, payments, tenancy, secrets, destructive
migration, production, or shared-infrastructure risk. High assurance is an
exception triggered by evidence, not the routine operating mode.

Do not switch the root to Luna, silently fall back to a different worker model,
launch another agent CLI, loosen permissions, expose secrets, auto-commit,
push, deploy, or start paid setup smoke tests. Normal delegated implementation
uses the provider pinned by the installed V4.1 Luna route; obey the user's
data-sharing and spending restrictions. Installation is not evidence of a
successful routed model request.
