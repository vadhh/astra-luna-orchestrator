# Install using Codex

Give Codex the location of this repository and the prompt below. This authorization covers only installation, not a real delegated task.

```text
Install Astra + Luna for Codex from this repository.

Use worker route gpt-5.6-luna. Do not substitute another worker model.

Read README.md, install.py, POLICY.md and WORKER-INSTRUCTIONS.md first.
Inspect relevant local configuration without printing secrets, full private
Router URLs, authentication contents or unrelated instructions.

Preserve my current Astra root model and reasoning effort,
config.toml, authentication, permissions and unrelated instructions. Do not
install another runtime, dependencies or Router, restart services, or quit Codex.
Do not add, change or remove [agents].default_subagent_model or
[agents].default_subagent_reasoning_effort. The package's named role pins its own
worker model and catalog-supported effort.

Verify Python 3.11+, native subagent/custom-role client support, and the selected
worker route in the effective configuration/catalog.
The default python3 may be older than 3.11; find an existing 3.11+ interpreter
such as python3.12 and use it for every command here. Do not install or upgrade a
runtime to satisfy this.
The package supports loopback /v1 and /_codex-router/<capability>/v1 endpoints.
If configuration is contradictory or unsupported, report the discrepancy.
Do not silently change models/providers or bypass preflight.
Never edit config.toml to make a preflight check pass. Report the discrepancy and
stop. Appending a table header such as [agents] to config.toml absorbs every
top-level key written after it and can stop Codex loading its config at all.

Do not ask me to paste a key into chat, inspect credential contents, or enter a key
for me. Do not run paid inference during installation. If the selected route is
not advertised with multi_agent_version v1 or v2, stop and report that prerequisite.

Run the offline tests, then install.py for a dry run. If they pass and the
proposed files match the documented scope, apply with install.py --apply.
I authorize installation of the personal skill, native astra_luna_builder role,
and scoped managed AGENTS policy exception. Retain repository restrictions,
explicit no-delegation instructions and managed security controls.

The role must pin Luna, inherit sandbox/approvals and disable nested agents.
Do not invoke an external worker CLI. Run the static doctor after installation.
An optional local catalog GET may fail when authentication is required; do not
read or alter credentials to make it pass, or present it as inference evidence.

Verify config/auth files and existing permissions are unchanged and unrelated
policy content is preserved. Report installed paths, root/worker settings,
test results, undo receipt and remaining runtime limitations.

Do not launch workers, run paid inference, commit, push or deploy during setup.
Explain that I should fully quit/reopen the host app and start an Astra session and invoke
$astra-luna-orchestrator. Actual route verification belongs to the first
separately authorized useful task, using host metadata.
