# Validation evidence

Unreleased candidate based on version 1.2.0. Checked September 20, 2026 on macOS
with Python 3.14.3.

## Verified

- 63 offline tests passed. Coverage includes installation dry runs, idempotence,
  original configuration preservation, scoped policy handling,
  profile/collision/symlink checks, URL validation, fake-secret redaction,
  generated role TOML, rollback, guarded undo, plan validation and release-file
  filtering.
- Every documented V4.1 Luna route is accepted only when explicitly selected or
  preserved from an existing valid package binding and advertised as
  `multi_agent_version: "v2"`. Tests cover OpenRouter role generation, remembered
  update behavior, unreviewed-route rejection, uncertified-route rejection and
  refusal to fall back from direct DeepSeek to an available alternate provider.
- Native `/v1` and capability-path Router configurations are accepted; non-loopback hosts and unsupported URL shapes are rejected.
- Existing backup-directory permissions are preserved.
- Backup files and caches are excluded from skill installation. Release tests also cover private artifact exclusion, symlink rejection and inventory changes.

All tests use synthetic configuration, temporary directories and a local HTTP fixture. They do not require a provider account or invoke model inference. Python 3.11 is the minimum supported syntax/runtime target, but this release's local suite was run on 3.14.3; other versions and operating systems have not been tested here.

## Prior local installation evidence

The preceding package revision was installed in a macOS Codex setup using an Astra root and the exact Luna worker route. Static configuration checks passed; root configuration and authentication bytes were preserved. Its optional unauthenticated local catalog GET was rejected. The public revision's installer is verified with synthetic homes; this report does not claim it was reapplied to that real installation.

## Still unverified

Actual delegated inference through the newly supported alternate providers,
native role loading for those routes in a fresh session, provider request
attribution, long-running build quality and cost savings remain unverified for
this candidate. A static report, a model catalog entry, or a worker naming itself
cannot establish these facts.

Validate real routing during the first authorized useful task, using host/router request metadata. Do not run an extra paid test as part of installation, and do not publish raw private logs or local configuration as evidence.
